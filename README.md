Exp 8 : Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio
Generation
 Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
 Objective
To explore how artificial intelligence models can generate realistic music
and voice outputs using only textual prompts. This experiment aims to
investigate how the structure, style, and specificity of prompts influence
the quality and creativity of AI-generated audio.
 Behind the Sound: The Idea
Imagine telling a computer: “Make a gentle jazz tune with light rain in
the background.” Or “Read this like a storyteller with an Indian accent.”
– and within seconds, it delivers audio that sounds human-made.
This is the essence of prompt engineering for audio generation –
crafting the right words to spark creativity in AI models like MusicGen, Bark, and Tortoise TTS.  The Blueprint (Methodology)
Choose the Audio Type
What do we want to hear? A song? Nature sounds? A voice?
→ We chose:
 Music (lo-fi, cinematic)
 Voice Narration (storytelling, formal speaking)
Select AI Models
We picked the following tools based on their specialties:
 MusicGen by Meta — for creating instrumental audio
 Bark by Suno — for expressive speech
 Tortoise TTS — for realistic storytelling voices
Design the Prompts
The magic lies in words. Prompts were written to include:
 Genre
 Mood
 Instruments / Sound effects
 Voice style, tone, age, accent
 Prompt Engineering in Action
 MusicGen Samples:
Prompt 1:
“Create a slow lo-fi hip-hop beat with vinyl crackle, ambient rain,
and soft piano for studying.”
→ Result: Smooth, mellow tune with subtle rain and vinyl texture.
Prompt 2:
“Generate a dramatic orchestral theme with fast strings, booming
drums, and heroic brass.”
→ Result: Epic soundtrack perfect for a fantasy trailer.
 Bark Speech Samples:
Prompt 3:
“Narrate this with an American female voice in a cheerful tone:
'Welcome to the future of AI audio!'”
→ Result: Lively voice with proper pacing and energy.
Prompt 4:
“Use a calm male British accent to say: ‘In a world where
machines can sing, magic begins.’”
→ Result: Polished, professional delivery.
 Tortoise TTS Sample:
Prompt 5:
“Read this like an elderly storyteller with warm, deep tone: ‘Long
ago, in a land of machines…’”
→ Result: Incredibly natural, soft-spoken narration.
 What Happened: Experiment Steps
Step Description
1  Identified audio types (Music + Voice)
2  Selected AI tools (MusicGen, Bark, Tortoise TTS)
3  Designed prompts with clarity and creativity
4  Used Hugging Face and Colab notebooks to run models
5  Generated audio in WAV/MP3 formats
6  Evaluated sound quality, clarity, emotion, and relevance
7  Refined prompts based on feedback
8  Documented outcomes and saved audio files
 What We Learned
 MusicGen:
 Works best with detailed prompts (tempo + instrument + mood)
 Can layer effects like crackle, bass, rain — but subtlety varies
 Bark:
 Strong with accents, emotions, character voices
 Best for storytelling, informal scripts
 Tortoise TTS:
 Incredibly lifelike voices
 Slower generation time, but higher realism
✨ Enhanced Prompts (Examples)
 “Compose a 1-minute ambient lo-fi track with layered piano, light
thunder, distant rain, and vinyl textures. Slow and calming.”
 “Narrate with an excited young Indian female voice: 'Let’s discover
how machines turn words into music!'”
✅ Result
The project proved the power of prompt engineering in audio generation.
Small tweaks in words led to major changes in audio quality and tone.
The AI models were surprisingly creative when guided by clear,
imaginative instructions.
 Conclusion
AI-powered audio generation is not just science — it’s art. Like giving
direction to a composer or voice actor, your prompt is the script. The
clearer and more expressive it is, the better the AI performs.
With the right models and carefully written prompts, we created:
 Original music for background environments
 Realistic narration with emotional expression
 Experiments showing how AI responds to different tones, accents,
and genres.
This exploration opens doors to automated content creation, podcast
production, sound design, and more.
